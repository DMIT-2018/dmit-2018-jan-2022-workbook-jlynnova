//Aggregates
//.Count()	counts the number of instances in the collection
//.Sum(x => ...) sums (totals) a numeric field (numeric expression) in the collection
//.Min(x => ...) finds the minumum value of a collection of values for a field
//.Max(x => ...) finds the maximum value of a collection of values for a field
//.Average(x => ...) finds the average value of a collection of values for a field

//IMPORTANT!!!!
//Aggregates work ONLY on a collection of values for a particular field
//Aggregates DO NOT work on a single row

//syntax
//query
//	(from ....
//   ...
//  select expression).aggregate()
//the expression is resolved to a single field value for Sum,Min,Max,Average

//method
//  collectionset.aggregate(x => epresssion)
//  collectionset.Select(x => expresion).aggregrate()
//  collectionset.Count()  //.Count() does not contain an expression
//the expression is resolved to a single field value for Sum,Min,Max,Average

//you can use multiple aggregates on a single column .Sum(x => expression).Min(x => expression)

//Find the average playing time (length) of tracks in our music collection

//thought process
//average is an aggregate
//what is the collection? a track is a member of the Tracks table
//what is the expression? Milliseconds

//query
(from x in Tracks
 select x.Milliseconds).Average()


//method
//Tracks.Average() //aborts because collection has mulitple fields
Tracks.Average(x => x.Milliseconds)
Tracks.Select(x => x.Milliseconds).Average()

//List all Albums of the 60s showing the title, artist and various
//aggregates for albums containing tracks.

//For each album show the number of tracks, the longest playing track,
//the shortest playing track, the total price of all tracks and the
//average playing length of the album tracks

//HINT: Albums has two navigational properties
//			Artist: points to the single parent record
//			Tracks: points to the collection of child records (tracks) of the album
